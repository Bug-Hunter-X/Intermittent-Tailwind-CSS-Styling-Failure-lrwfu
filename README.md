# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are inconsistently applied.  The issue is intermittent, meaning that sometimes the styles render correctly, while at other times they do not.  The root cause remains elusive. This repo contains example files illustrating the issue and a proposed solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions may vary depending on your project setup).
3. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Potential Causes

* **Caching Issues:** While cache clearing is attempted in the bug report, persistent, hard-to-find caching issues can still arise.
* **Build Process Errors:** Problems in the build process could be interfering with Tailwind's class processing.
* **Conflicting Styles:** Other CSS might unintentionally override Tailwind's styles.
* **Tailwind Configuration:** While the `tailwind.config.js` file is checked, there might still be underlying configurations causing issues. 
* **Browser Extensions:** A browser extension could be interfering with the rendering.

## Solution (Potential)

The provided solution aims to increase consistency by addressing potential caching issues and ensuring correct compilation and application of Tailwind CSS styles.
