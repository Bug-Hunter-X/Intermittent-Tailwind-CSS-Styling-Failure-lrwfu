The solution focuses on double-checking various aspects to rule out the causes mentioned above:

1. **Explicitly Purge Unused Styles:** Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` file includes `purge` or its updated equivalent (`content`)  with precise paths pointing to your HTML, and remove any unnecessary files to improve build speed and clarity.
2. **Purge Options and Content:** Add purge options to carefully filter out and retain only necessary styles. Experiment with different configurations to ensure that your styles are properly purgeable.
3. **Inspect Network Requests:** If issues remain, monitor browser network requests to ensure that Tailwind CSS files are actually being loaded and are free of errors.
4. **Disable Browser Extensions:** Temporarily disable browser extensions known to interact with CSS or JavaScript.
5. **Re-create the project:** Create a new minimal project that only has Tailwind and check if the problem persists. This will help identify if there's a problem in the project's original configuration.
